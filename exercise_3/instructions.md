# Exercise 3: Generate tests and docs

## Steps:

1. **Generate tests.**
    Above any function you should see the grey text "Codeium: Refactor ...".
    1. Choose any function in any of the refactored files.
    2. Press "Refactor".
    3. Then press "Generate unit tests".
    4. You will get proposed tests in the Codeium Chat.
    5. You can choose to get the proposed solution in a "New File" or "Copy Code" at the top right of the suggested code. Press any of them and save the tests into a new file.
    6. Read through the tests and check if you think the tests makes sense for the function that you chose.
    7. Run the tests in the terminal:
        python3.11 <name-of-file.py>
        (replace <name-of-file.py> with the name of the file that you saved it as).
    8. If the test does not make sense or isn't working. Explain it in the chat and try to get it to work.
    9. If you want to generate more tests, repeat from 1.

2. **Generate docs.**
    Above any function you should see the grey text "Codeium: Refactor | Explain | Generate Docstring".
    1. Choose any function in any of the refactored files.
    2. Press "Generate Docstring".
    4. You will get a proposed docstring from Copilot that you can either accept or reject.
    6. If you want to generate more docstrings, repeat from 1.
