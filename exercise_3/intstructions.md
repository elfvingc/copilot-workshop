# Exercise 3: Generate tests

## Steps:

1. **Generate tests.**
    Above any function you should see the grey text "Codeium: Refactor ...".
    1. Choose any function in any of the refactored files.
    2. Press "Refactor".
    3. Then press "Generate unit tests".
    4. You will get proposed tests in the Codeium Chat.
    5. Use "Copy Code" at the top right of the suggested code. Save the tests into the file tests.py.
    6. Read through the tests and check if you think the tests makes sense for the function that you chose.
    7. Run the tests in the terminal:
        python3.11 tests.py
    8. If the test does not make sense or isn't working. Explain it in the chat and try to get it to work.
    9. If you want to generate more tests, repeat from 1.
