# Exercise 6: Fix bugs in game

## Suggested workflow

- Explain the bugs (one by one) and try to get copilot to fix them.

The suggested workflow is described in detail below.

### Steps:

1. **Explain the bug to copilot and try to get copilot to fix it.**
    - Use the chat, or "Refactor" above a function and select "Check for bugs and null pointers", or mark a code block and open the Codium command (ctrl + i or ctrl + shift + i (depending on your keybindings))

2. **Verify that it works  as expected.**
    Run the file you chose with:
        python3 <name-of-file>
