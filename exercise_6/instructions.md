# Exercise 6: Add more functionalities

In this exercise, try to add more functionalities to the game of pong. You are free to add whatever you want in this exercise as long as you use copilot to do it. We encourage you to try out autocompletions, command and chat.

## Suggested workflow

1. Use chat to get ideas or use any of the provided ideas below to improve the game.
2. Implement the code using copilot.

## Steps:

1. Choose functionality to add:
   - Either:
        1. Use the Codeium chat to get suggestions on improvements or how to make the game more fun.
        2. Or use any of the following:
            1. Add win condition.
            2. Increase/decrease game difficulty.
            3. Power-ups.
2. Implement the code using autocompletions or command (ctrl + i, for some it might be ctrl + shift + i). (Use chat as a last resort if you get stuck).
3. Try out the new functionality by running the game (run main.sh).
4. If you get any errors, try fixing them with copilot.
