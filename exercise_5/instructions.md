# Exercise 5: Add more functionalities

You are free to do whatever you want in this exercise as long as you use copilot to do it. We encourage you to use autocompletions the most, command second and chat third.

## Suggested workflow

1. Use chat to get ideas or use any of the provided ideas to improve the game.
2. Implement the code using copilot.

## Steps:

1. Choose functionality to add:
   - Either:
        1. Use the Codeium chat to get suggestions on improvements or how to make the game more fun.
        2. Or use any of the following:
            1. Add score and show it above the playing field.
            2. Add win condition.
            3. Increase/decrease game difficulty.
            4. Power-ups.
2. Implement the code using autocompletions or command (ctrl + shift + i). (Use chat as a last resort if you get stuck).
3. Try out the new functionality by running the game.
4. If you get any errors, try fixing them with copilot.
